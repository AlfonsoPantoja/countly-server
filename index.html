        <h2>What's Countly?</h2>

<p>Countly is an innovative, real-time, open source mobile analytics application. It collects data from mobile phones, and visualizes this information to analyze mobile application usage and end-user behavior. There are two parts of Countly: the server that collects and analyzes data, and mobile SDK that sends this data (for iOS &amp; Android).</p>

<p>Below you can find Countly SDK repositories. Each SDK has its own installation instruction.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Countly/countly-sdk-android">Countly Android SDK (countly-sdk-android)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Countly/countly-sdk-ios">Countly iOS SDK (countly-sdk-ios)</a></li>
</ul><h2>How do I install Countly server?</h2>

<p>We provide a beautiful installation sript (<code>bin/countly.install.sh</code>) with countly-server package that installs and configures everything required to run Countly Server.</p>
